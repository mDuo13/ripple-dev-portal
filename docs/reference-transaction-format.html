<p>A <em>Transaction</em> is the only way to modify the Ripple Ledger. Transactions are only valid if signed, submitted, and accepted into a validated ledger version following the <a href="https://ripple.com/build/ripple-ledger-consensus-process/">consensus process</a>. Some ledger rules also generate <em><a href="#pseudo-transactions">pseudo-transactions</a></em>, which aren't signed or submitted, but still must be accepted by consensus. Transactions that fail are also included in ledgers because they modify balances of XRP to pay for the anti-spam <a href="concept-transaction-cost.html">transaction cost</a>.</p>

<h2 id="authorizing-transactions">Authorizing Transactions</h2>
<p>In the decentralized Ripple Consensus Ledger, a digital signature proves that a transaction is authorized to do a specific set of actions. Only signed transactions can be submitted to the network and included in a validated ledger. A signed transaction is immutable: its contents cannot change, and the signature is not valid for any other transaction. <!-- STYLE_OVERRIDE: is authorized to --></p>
<p>A transaction can be authorized by any of the following types of signatures:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single signature from the master secret key that is mathematically associated with the sending address. You can disable or enable the master key using an <a href="#accountset">AccountSet transaction</a>.</li>
<li>A single signature that matches a regular key associated with the address. You can add, remove, or replace a regular key using a <a href="#setregularkey">SetRegularKey transaction</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="#multi-signing">multi-signature</a> that matches a list of signers owned by the address. You can add, remove, or replace a list of signers using a <a href="#signerlistset">SignerListSet transaction</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any signature type can authorize any type of transaction, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the master key can <a href="#accountset-flags">disable the master key</a>.</li>
<li>Only the master key can <a href="concept-freeze.html#no-freeze">permanently give up the ability to freeze</a>.</li>
<li>You can never remove the last method of signing transactions from an address.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="signing-and-submitting-transactions">Signing and Submitting Transactions</h2>
<p>Sending a transaction to the Ripple Consensus Ledger involves several steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an <a href="#unsigned-transaction-format">unsigned transaction in JSON format</a>.</li>
<li>Use one or more signatures to <a href="#authorizing-transactions">authorize the transaction</a>.</li>
<li>Submit a transaction to a <code>rippled</code> server. If the transaction is properly formed, the server provisionally applies the transaction to its current version of the ledger and relays the transaction to other members of the peer-to-peer network.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://ripple.com/build/ripple-ledger-consensus-process/">consensus process</a> determines which provisional transactions get included in the next validated ledger.</li>
<li>The <code>rippled</code> servers apply those transactions to the previous ledger in a canonical order and share their results.</li>
<li>If enough <a href="tutorial-rippled-setup.html#reasons-to-run-a-validator">trusted validators</a> created the exact same ledger, that ledger is declared <em>validated</em> and the <a href="#transaction-results">results of the transactions</a> in that ledger are immutable.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="unsigned-transaction-format">Unsigned Transaction Format</h3>
<p>Here is an example of an unsigned <a href="#payment">Payment transaction</a> in JSON:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "TransactionType" : "Payment",
  "Account" : "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn",
  "Destination" : "ra5nK24KXen9AHvsdFTKHSANinZseWnPcX",
  "Amount" : {
     "currency" : "USD",
     "value" : "1",
     "issuer" : "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn"
  },
  "Fee": "10",
  "Flags": 2147483648,
  "Sequence": 2,
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Ripple Consensus Ledger only relays and executes a transaction if the transaction object has been authorized by the sending address (in the <code>Account</code>) field. For transactions authorized by only a single signature, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert it to a binary blob and sign it offline. This is preferable, since it means that the account secret used for signing the transaction is never transmitted over any network connection.<ul>
<li>You can use <a href="reference-rippleapi.html#sign">RippleAPI</a> for offline signing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have a <code>rippled</code> server sign the transaction for you. The <a href="reference-rippled.html#sign">sign command</a> takes a JSON-format transaction and secret and returns the signed binary transaction format ready for submission. (Transmitting your account secret is dangerous, so you should only do this from within a trusted and encrypted connection, or through a local connection, and only to a server you control.)<ul>
<li>As a shortcut, you can use the <a href="reference-rippled.html#submit">submit command</a> with a <code>tx_json</code> object to sign and submit a transaction all at once. This is only recommended for testing and development purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case, signing a transaction generates a binary blob that can be submitted to the network. This means using <code>rippled</code>'s <a href="reference-rippled.html#submit">submit command</a>. Here is an example of the same transaction, as a signed blob, being submitted with the WebSocket API:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "id": 2,
  "command": "submit",
  "tx_blob" : "120000240000000461D4838D7EA4C6800000000000000000000000000055534400000000004B4E9C06F24296074F7BC48F92A97916C6DC5EA968400000000000000F732103AB40A0490F9B7ED8DF29D246BF2D6269820A0EE7742ACDD457BEA7C7D0931EDB74483046022100982064CDD3F052D22788DB30B52EEA8956A32A51375E72274E417328EBA31E480221008F522C9DB4B0F31E695AA013843958A10DE8F6BA7D6759BEE645F71A7EB240BE81144B4E9C06F24296074F7BC48F92A97916C6DC5EA983143E9D4A2B8AA0780F682D136F7A56D6724EF53754"
}
</code></pre>
<p>After a transaction has been submitted, you can check its status using the API, for example using the <a href="reference-rippled.html#tx">tx command</a>.</p>
<p class="devportal-callout caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> The success of a transaction is not final unless the transaction appears in a <strong>validated</strong> ledger with the result code <code>tesSUCCESS</code>. See also: <a href="#finality-of-results">Finality of Results</a>.</p>
<p>Example response from the <code>tx</code> command:</p>

<h3 id="multi-signing">Multi-Signing</h3>
<p>Multi-signing in Ripple is the act of <a href="#authorizing-transactions">authorizing transactions</a> for the Ripple Consensus Ledger by using a combination of multiple secret keys. You can have any combination of authorization methods enabled for your address, including multi-signing, a master key, and a <a href="#setregularkey">regular key</a>. (The only requirement is that <em>at least one</em> method must be enabled.)</p>
<p>The <a href="#signerlistset">SignerListSet transaction</a> defines which addresses can authorize transactions from your address. You can include up to 8 addresses in a SignerList. You can control how many signatures are needed, in which combinations, by using the quorum and weight values of the SignerList.</p>
<p>To successfully submit a multi-signed transaction, you must do all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The address sending the transaction (specified in the <code>Account</code> field) must own a <a href="reference-ledger-format.html#signerlist"><code>SignerList</code> in the ledger</a>.</li>
<li>The transaction must include the <code>SigningPubKey</code> field as an empty string.</li>
<li>The transaction must include a <a href="#signers-field"><code>Signers</code> field</a> containing an array of signatures.</li>
<li>The signatures present in the <code>Signers</code> array must match signers defined in the SignerList.</li>
<li>For the provided signatures, the total <code>weight</code> associated with those signers must be equal or greater than the <code>quorum</code> for the SignerList.</li>
<li>The <a href="concept-transaction-cost.html">transaction cost</a> (specified in the <code>Fee</code> field) must be at least (N+1) times the normal transaction cost, where N is the number of signatures provided.</li>
<li>All fields of the transaction must be defined before collecting signatures. You cannot <a href="#auto-fillable-fields">auto-fill</a> any fields.</li>
<li>If presented in binary form, the <code>Signers</code> array must be sorted based on the numeric value of the signer addresses, with the lowest value first. (If submitted as JSON, the <a href="reference-rippled.html#submit-multisigned"><code>submit_multisigned</code> command</a> handles this automatically.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="tutorial-multisign.html">How to Multi-Sign</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reliable-transaction-submission">Reliable Transaction Submission</h3>
<p>Reliably submitting transactions is the process of achieving both of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idempotency - A transaction should be processed once and only once, or not at all.</li>
<li>Verifiability - Applications can determine the final result of a transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>To have both qualities when submitting a transaction, an application should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Construct and sign the transaction first, including a <a href="#lastledgersequence"><code>LastLedgerSequence</code></a> parameter that gives the transaction a limited lifespan.</li>
<li>Persist details of the transaction before submitting.</li>
<li>Submit the transaction.</li>
<li>Confirm that the transaction was either included in a validated ledger, or that it has expired due to <code>LastLedgerSequence</code>.</li>
<li>If a transaction fails or expires, you can modify and resubmit it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Main article: <a href="tutorial-reliable-transaction-submission.html">Reliable Transaction Submission</a></p>
<h3 id="identifying-transactions">Identifying Transactions</h3>
<p>The <code>"hash"</code> is the unique value that identifies a particular transaction. The server provides the hash in the response when you submit the transaction; you can also look up a transaction in an account's transaction history with the <a href="reference-rippled.html#account-tx">account_tx command</a>.</p>
<p>The transaction hash can be used as a "proof of payment" since anyone can <a href="#looking-up-transaction-results">look up the transaction by its hash</a> to verify its final status.</p>
<h2 id="common-fields">Common Fields</h2>
<p>Every transaction type has the same set of fundamental fields. Field names are case-sensitive. The common fields for all transactions are:</p>

</table>
<h3 id="auto-fillable-fields">Auto-fillable Fields</h3>
<p>Some fields can be automatically filled in before the transaction is signed, either by a <code>rippled</code> server or by the library used for offline signing. Both <a href="https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib">ripple-lib</a> and <code>rippled</code> can automatically provide the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Fee</code> - Automatically fill in the <a href="concept-transaction-cost.html">transaction cost</a> based on the network. (<em>Note:</em> <code>rippled</code>'s <a href="reference-rippled.html#sign">sign command</a> supports limits on how high the filled-in-value is, using the <code>fee_mult_max</code> parameter.)</li>
<li><code>Sequence</code> - Automatically use the next sequence number for the account sending the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a production system, we recommend <em>not</em> leaving these fields to be filled by the server. For example, if transaction costs become high due to a temporary spike in network load, you may want to wait for the cost to decrease before sending some transactions, instead of paying the temporarily-high cost.</p>
<p>The <a href="#paths"><code>Paths</code> field</a> of the <a href="#payment">Payment</a> transaction type can also be automatically filled in.</p>
<h3 id="transaction-cost">Transaction Cost</h3>
<p>To protect the Ripple Consensus Ledger from being disrupted by spam and denial-of-service attacks, each transaction must destroy a small amount of XRP. This <em><a href="concept-transaction-cost.html">transaction cost</a></em> is designed to increase along with the load on the network, making it very expensive to deliberately or inadvertently overload the network.</p>
<p>The <code>Fee</code> field specifies an amount, in <a href="reference-rippled.html#specifying-currency-amounts">drops of XRP</a>, to destroy as the cost for relaying this transaction. If the transaction is included in a validated ledger (whether or not it achieves its intended purpose), then the amount of XRP specified in the <code>Fee</code> parameter is destroyed forever. You can <a href="concept-transaction-cost.html#querying-the-transaction-cost">look up the transaction cost</a> in advance, or <a href="concept-transaction-cost.html#automatically-specifying-the-transaction-cost">let <code>rippled</code> set it automatically</a> when you sign a transaction.</p>
<p class="devportal-callout note"><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="#multi-signing">Multi-signed transactions</a> require additional fees to relay to the network.</p>
<h3 id="canceling-or-skipping-a-transaction">Canceling or Skipping a Transaction</h3>
<p>An important and intentional feature of the Ripple Network is that a transaction is final as soon as it has been incorporated in a validated ledger.</p>
<p>However, if a transaction has not yet been included in a validated ledger, you can effectively cancel it by rendering it invalid. Typically, this means sending another transaction with the same <code>Sequence</code> value from the same account. If you do not want the replacement transaction to do anything, send an <a href="#accountset">AccountSet</a> transaction with no options.</p>
<p>For example, if you try to submit 3 transactions with sequence numbers 11, 12, and 13, but transaction 11 gets lost somehow or does not have a high enough <a href="#transaction-cost">transaction cost</a> to be propagated to the network, then you can cancel transaction 11 by submitting an AccountSet transaction with no options and sequence number 11. This does nothing (except destroying the transaction cost for the new transaction 11), but it allows transactions 12 and 13 to become valid.</p>
<p>This approach is preferable to renumbering and resubmitting transactions 12 and 13, because it prevents transactions from being effectively duplicated under different sequence numbers.</p>
<p>In this way, an AccountSet transaction with no options is the canonical "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP">no-op</a>" transaction.</p>
<h3 id="lastledgersequence">LastLedgerSequence</h3>
<p>We strongly recommend that you specify the <code>LastLedgerSequence</code> parameter on every transaction. Provide a value of about 3 higher than <a href="reference-rippled.html#ledger">the most recent ledger index</a> to ensure that your transaction is either validated or rejected within a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>Without the <code>LastLedgerSequence</code> parameter, a transaction can become stuck in an undesirable state where it is neither validated nor rejected for a long time. Specifically, if the load-based <a href="#transaction-cost">transaction cost</a> of the network increases after you send a transaction, your transaction may not get propagated enough to be included in a validated ledger, but you would have to pay the (increased) transaction cost to <a href="#canceling-or-skipping-a-transaction">send another transaction canceling it</a>. Later, if the transaction cost decreases again, the transaction can become included in a future ledger. The <code>LastLedgerSequence</code> places a hard upper limit on how long the transaction can wait to be validated or rejected.</p>
<h3 id="accounttxnid">AccountTxnID</h3>
<p>The <code>AccountTxnID</code> field lets you chain your transactions together, so that a current transaction is not valid unless the previous one (by Sequence Number) is also valid and matches the transaction you expected.</p>
<p>One situation in which this is useful is if you have a primary system for submitting transactions and a passive backup system. If the passive backup system becomes disconnected from the primary, but the primary is not fully dead, and they both begin operating at the same time, you could potentially have serious problems like some transactions sending twice and others not at all. Chaining your transactions together with <code>AccountTxnID</code> ensures that, even if both systems are active, only one of them can submit valid transactions at a time.</p>
<p>To use AccountTxnID, you must first set the <a href="#accountset-flags">asfAccountTxnID</a> flag, so that the ledger keeps track of the ID for the account's previous transaction.</p>
<h3 id="memos">Memos</h3>
<p>The <code>Memos</code> field includes arbitrary messaging data with the transaction. It is presented as an array of objects. Each object has only one field, <code>Memo</code>, which in turn contains another object with <em>one or more</em> of the following fields:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The MemoType and MemoFormat fields should only consist of the following characters: <code>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-._~:/?#[]@!$&amp;'()*+,;=%</code></p>
<p>The <code>Memos</code> field is limited to no more than 1KB in size (when serialized in binary format).</p>

            }
        }
    ],
    "Amount": "1"
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="signers-field">Signers Field</h3>
<p>The <code>Signers</code> field contains a <a href="#multi-signing">multi-signature</a>, which has signatures from up to 8 key pairs, that together should authorize the transaction. The <code>Signers</code> list is an array of objects, each with one field, <code>Signer</code>. The <code>Signer</code> field has the following nested fields:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Field</th>
<th align="left">Type</th>
<th align="left"><a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/master/src/ripple/protocol/impl/SField.cpp">Internal Type</a></th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">Account</td>
<td align="left">String</td>
<td align="left">AccountID</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">SigningPubKey</td>
<td align="left">String</td>
<td align="left">PubKey</td>
<td align="left">The public key used to create this signature.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <code>SigningPubKey</code> must be a key that is associated with the <code>Account</code> address. If the referenced <code>Account</code> is a funded account in the ledger, then the SigningPubKey can be that account's current Regular Key if one is set. It could also be that account's Master Key, unless the <a href="reference-ledger-format.html#accountroot-flags">lsfDisableMaster</a> flag is enabled. If the referenced <code>Account</code> address is not a funded account in the ledger, then the <code>SigningPubKey</code> must be the master key associated with that address.</p>
<p>Because signature verification is a compute-intensive task, multi-signed transactions cost additional XRP to relay to the network. Each signature included in the multi-signature increases the <a href="concept-transaction-cost.html">transaction cost</a> required for the transaction. For example, if the current minimum transaction cost to relay a transaction to the network is <code>10000</code> drops, then a multi-signed transaction with 3 entries in the <code>Signers</code> array would need a <code>Fee</code> value of at least <code>40000</code> drops to relay.</p>
<h3 id="flags">Flags</h3>
<p>The <code>Flags</code> field can contain various options that affect how a transaction should behave. The options are represented as binary values that can be combined with bitwise-or operations to set multiple flags at once.</p>
<p>Most flags only have meaning for a specific transaction type. The same bitwise value may be reused for flags on different transaction types, so it is important to pay attention to the <code>TransactionType</code> field when setting and reading flags.</p>
<p>The only flag that applies globally to all transactions is as follows:</p>

<h1 id="transaction-types">Transaction Types</h1>
<p>The type of a transaction (<code>TransactionType</code> field) is the most fundamental information about a transaction. This indicates what operations it can or is supposed to perform.</p>
<p>All transactions have certain fields in common:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#common-fields">Common Fields</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each transaction type has additional fields relevant to the type of action it causes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#accountset">AccountSet - Set options on an account</a></li>
<li><a href="#escrowcancel">EscrowCancel - Reclaim escrowed XRP</a></li>
<li><a href="#escrowcreate">EscrowCreate - Create an escrowed XRP payment</a></li>

<li><a href="#offercancel">OfferCancel - Withdraw a currency-exchange order</a></li>
<li><a href="#offercreate">OfferCreate - Submit an order to exchange currency</a></li>
<li><a href="#payment">Payment - Send funds from one account to another</a></li>
<li><a href="#paymentchannelclaim">PaymentChannelClaim - Claim money from a payment channel</a></li>
<li><a href="#paymentchannelcreate">PaymentChannelCreate - Open a new payment channel</a></li>
<li><a href="#paymentchannelfund">PaymentChannelFund - Add more XRP to a payment channel</a></li>

</ul>
<p><em>Pseudo-Transactions</em> that are not created and submitted in the usual way, but may be added to open ledgers according to ledger rules. They still must be approved by consensus to be included in a validated ledger. Pseudo-transactions have their own unique transaction types:</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="accountset-flags">AccountSet Flags</h3>
<p>There are several options which can be either enabled or disabled for an account. Account options are represented by different types of flags depending on the situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>AccountSet</code> transaction type has several "AccountSet Flags" (prefixed <strong>asf</strong>) that can enable an option when passed as the <code>SetFlag</code> parameter, or disable an option when passed as the <code>ClearFlag</code> parameter.</li>
<li>The <code>AccountSet</code> transaction type has several transaction flags (prefixed <strong>tf</strong>) that can be used to enable or disable specific account options when passed in the <code>Flags</code> parameter. This style is discouraged. New account options do not have corresponding transaction (tf) flags.</li>
<li>The <code>AccountRoot</code> ledger node type has several ledger-specific-flags (prefixed <strong>lsf</strong>) which represent the state of particular account options within a particular ledger. Naturally, the values apply until a later ledger version changes them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The preferred way to enable and disable Account Flags is using the <code>SetFlag</code> and <code>ClearFlag</code> parameters of an AccountSet transaction. AccountSet flags have names that begin with <strong>asf</strong>.</p>
<p>All flags are off by default.</p>
<p>The available AccountSet flags are:</p>

<h4 id="blocking-incoming-transactions">Blocking Incoming Transactions</h4>
<p>Incoming transactions with unclear purposes may be an inconvenience for financial institutions, who would have to recognize when a customer made a mistake, and then potentially refund accounts or adjust balances depending on the mistake. The <code>asfRequireDest</code> and <code>asfDisallowXRP</code> flags are intended to protect users from accidentally sending funds in a way that is unclear about the reason the funds were sent.</p>
<p>For example, a destination tag is typically used to identify which hosted balance should be credited when a financial institution receives a payment. If the destination tag is omitted, it may be unclear which account should be credited, creating a need for refunds, among other problems. By using the <code>asfRequireDest</code> tag, you can ensure that every incoming payment has a destination tag, which makes it harder for others to send you an ambiguous payment by accident.</p>
<p>You can protect against unwanted incoming payments for non-XRP currencies by not creating trust lines in those currencies. Since XRP does not require trust, the <code>asfDisallowXRP</code> flag is used to discourage users from sending XRP to an account. However, this flag is not enforced in <code>rippled</code> because it could potentially cause accounts to become unusable. (If an account did not have enough XRP to send a transaction that disabled the flag, the account would be completely unusable.) Instead, client applications should disallow or discourage XRP payments to accounts with the <code>asfDisallowXRP</code> flag enabled.</p>
<h3 id="transferrate">TransferRate</h3>
<p>The TransferRate field specifies a fee to charge whenever counterparties transfer the currency you issue. See <a href="concept-transfer-fees.html">Transfer Fees</a> for more information.</p>
<p>In <code>rippled</code>'s WebSocket and JSON-RPC APIs, the TransferRate is represented as an integer, the amount that must be sent for 1 billion units to arrive. For example, a 20% transfer fee is represented as the value <code>1200000000</code>.  The value cannot be less than 1000000000. (Less than that would indicate giving away money for sending transactions, which is exploitable.) You can specify 0 as a shortcut for 1000000000, meaning no fee.</p>

<h3 id="lifecycle-of-an-offer">Lifecycle of an Offer</h3>
<p>When an OfferCreate transaction is processed, it automatically consumes matching or crossing offers to the extent possible. (If existing offers provide a better rate than requested, the offer creator could pay less than the full <code>TakerGets</code> amount to receive the entire <code>TakerPays</code> amount.) If that does not completely fulfill the <code>TakerPays</code> amount, then the offer becomes an Offer node in the ledger. (You can use <a href="#offercreate-flags">OfferCreate Flags</a> to modify this behavior.)</p>
<p>An offer in the ledger can be fulfilled either by additional OfferCreate transactions that match up with the existing offers, or by <a href="#payment">Payments</a> that use the offer to connect the payment path. Offers can be partially fulfilled and partially funded. A single transaction can consume up to 850 Offers from the ledger. (Any more than that, and the metadata becomes too large, resulting in <a href="#tec-codes"><code>tecOVERSIZE</code></a>.)</p>
<p>You can create an offer so long as you have at least some (any positive, nonzero amount) of the currency specified by the <code>TakerGets</code> parameter of the offer. The offer sells as much of the currency as you have, up to the <code>TakerGets</code> amount, until the <code>TakerPays</code> amount is satisfied. An offer cannot place anyone in debt.</p>
<p>It is possible for an offer to become temporarily or permanently <em>unfunded</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the creator no longer has any of the <code>TakerGets</code> currency.<ul>
<li>The offer becomes funded again when the creator obtains more of that currency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the currency required to fund the offer is held in a <a href="concept-freeze.html">frozen trust line</a>.<ul>
<li>The offer becomes funded again when the trust line is no longer frozen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the creator does not have enough XRP for the reserve amount of a new trust line required by the offer. (See <a href="#offers-and-trust">Offers and Trust</a>.)<ul>
<li>The offer becomes funded again when the creator obtains more XRP, or the reserve requirements decrease.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the Expiration time included in the offer is before the close time of the most recently-closed ledger. (See <a href="#expiration">Expiration</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>An unfunded offer can stay on the ledger indefinitely, but it does not have any effect. The only ways an offer can be <em>permanently</em> removed from the ledger are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It becomes fully claimed by a Payment or a matching OfferCreate transaction.</li>
<li>An OfferCancel or OfferCreate transaction explicitly cancels the offer.</li>
<li>An OfferCreate transaction from the same account crosses the earlier offer. (In this case, the older offer is automatically canceled.)</li>
<li>An offer is found to be unfunded during transaction processing, typically because it was at the tip of the orderbook.<ul>
<li>This includes cases where one side or the other of an offer is found to be closer to 0 than <code>rippled</code>'s precision supports.</li>

<p>Tracking the funding status of all offers can be computationally taxing. In particular, addresses that are actively trading may have a large number of offers open. A single balance can affect the funding status of many offers to buy different currencies. Because of this, <code>rippled</code> does not proactively find and remove offers.</p>
<p>A client application can locally track the funding status of offers. To do this, first retreive an order book using the <a href="reference-rippled.html#book-offers"><code>book_offers</code> command</a> and check the <code>taker_gets_funded</code> field of offers. Then,  <a href="reference-rippled.html#subscribe">subscribe</a> to the <code>transactions</code> stream and watch the transaction metadata to see which offers are modified.</p>
<h3 id="offers-and-trust">Offers and Trust</h3>
<p>The limit values of trust lines (See <a href="#trustset">TrustSet</a>) do not affect offers. In other words, you can use an offer to acquire more than the maximum amount you trust an issuer to redeem.</p>
<p>However, holding non-XRP balances still requires a trust line to the address issuing those balances. When an offer is taken, it automatically creates any necessary trust lines, setting their limits to 0. Because <a href="concept-reserves.html">trust lines increase the reserve an account must hold</a>, any offers that would require a new trust line also require the address to have enough XRP to meet the reserve for that trust line.</p>
<p>A trust line indicates an issuer you trust enough to accept their issuances as payment, within limits. Offers are explicit instructions to acquire certain issuances, so they are allowed to go beyond those limits.</p>
<h3 id="offer-preference">Offer Preference</h3>
<p>Existing offers are grouped by exchange rate (sometimes called "offer quality"), which is measured as the ratio between <code>TakerGets</code> and <code>TakerPays</code>. Offers with a higher exchange rate are taken preferentially. (That is, the person accepting the offer receives as much as possible for the amount of currency they pay out.) Offers with the same exchange rate are taken on the basis of which offer was placed in the earliest ledger version.</p>
<p>When offers of the same exchange rate are placed in the same ledger version, the order in which they are taken is determined by the <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/release/src/ripple/app/misc/CanonicalTXSet.cpp" title="Source: Transaction ordering">canonical order</a> in which the transactions were <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/5425a90f160711e46b2c1f1c93d68e5941e4bfb6/src/ripple/app/consensus/LedgerConsensus.cpp#L1435-L1538" title="Source: Applying transactions">applied to the ledger</a>. This behavior is designed to be deterministic, efficient, and hard to game.</p>
<h4 id="ticksize">TickSize</h4>
<p><em>Requires the <a href="concept-amendments.html#ticksize">TickSize amendment</a>.</em></p>
<p>When an Offer is placed into an order book, its exchange rate is truncated based on the <code>TickSize</code> values set by the issuers of the currencies involved in the Offer. When a trader offers to exchange XRP and an issued currency, the <code>TickSize</code> from the issuer of the currency applies. When a trader offers to exchange two issued currencies, the offer uses the smaller <code>TickSize</code> value (that is, the one with fewer significant digits). If neither currency has a <code>TickSize</code> set, the default behavior applies.</p>
<p>The <code>TickSize</code> value truncates the number of <em>significant digits</em> in the exchange rate of an offer when it gets placed in an order book. Issuers can set <code>TickSize</code> to an integer from <code>3</code> to <code>15</code> using an <a href="#accountset">AccountSet transaction</a>. The exchange rate is represented as a number of significant digits plus an exponent; the <code>TickSize</code> does not affect the exponent. This allows the Ripple Consensus Ledger to represent exchange rates between assets that vary greatly in value (for example, a hyperinflated currency compared to a rare commodity). The lower the <code>TickSize</code> an issuer sets, the larger the increment traders must offer to be considered a higher exchange rate than the existing Offers.</p>
<p>The <code>TickSize</code> does not affect the portion of an Offer that can be executed immediately. (For that reason, OfferCreate transactions with <code>tfImmediateOrCancel</code> are unaffected by <code>TickSize</code> values.) If the Offer cannot be fully executed, the transaction processing engine calculates the exchange rate and truncates it based on <code>TickSize</code>. Then, the engine rounds the remaining amount of the Offer from the "less important" side to match the truncated exchange rate. For a default OfferCreate transaction (a "buy" Offer), the <code>TakerPays</code> amount (the amount being bought) gets rounded. If the <code>tfSell</code> flag is enabled (a "sell" Offer) the <code>TakerGets</code> amount (the amount being sold) gets rounded.</p>
<p>When an issuer enables, disables, or changes the <code>TickSize</code>, Offers that were placed under the previous setting are unaffected.</p>
<h3 id="expiration">Expiration</h3>
<p>Since transactions can take time to propagate and confirm, the timestamp of a ledger is used to determine offer validity. An offer only expires when its Expiration time is before the most-recently validated ledger. In other words, an offer with an <code>Expiration</code> field is still considered "active" if its expiration time is later than the timestamp of the most-recently validated ledger, regardless of what your local clock says.</p>
<p>You can determine the final disposition of an offer with an <code>Expiration</code> as soon as you see a fully-validated ledger with a close time equal to or greater than the expiration time.</p>
<p class="devportal-callout note"><strong>Note:</strong> Since only new transactions can modify the ledger, an expired offer can stay on the ledger after it becomes inactive. The offer is treated as unfunded and has no effect, but it can continue to appear in results (for example, from the <a href="reference-rippled.html#ledger-entry">ledger_entry</a> command). Later on, the expired offer can get finally deleted as a result of another transaction (such as another OfferCreate) if the server finds it while processing.</p>
<p>If an OfferCreate transaction has an <code>Expiration</code> time that has already passed when the transaction first gets included in a ledger, the transaction does not execute the offer but still results in a <code>tesSUCCESS</code> transaction code. (This is because such a transaction could still successfully cancel another offer.)</p>
<h3 id="auto-bridging">Auto-Bridging</h3>
<p>Any OfferCreate that would exchange two non-XRP currencies could potentially use XRP as an intermediary currency in a synthetic order book. This is because of auto-bridging, which serves to improve liquidity across all currency pairs by using XRP as a vehicle currency. This works because of XRP's nature as a native cryptocurrency to the Ripple Consensus Ledger. Offer execution can use a combination of direct and auto-bridged offers to achieve the best total exchange rate.</p>
<p>Example: <em>Anita places an offer to sell GBP and buy BRL. She might fund that this uncommon currency market has few offers. There is one offer with a good rate, but it has insufficient quantity to satisfy Anita's trade. However, both GBP and BRL have active, competitive markets to XRP. Auto-bridging software finds a way to complete Anita's offer by purchasing XRP with GBP from one trader, then selling the XRP to another trader to buy BRL. Anita automatically gets the best rate possible by combining the small offer in the direct GBP:BRL market with the better composite rates created by pairing GBP:XRP and XRP:BRL offers.</em></p>
<p>Auto-bridging happens automatically on any OfferCreate transaction. <a href="#payment">Payment transactions</a> <em>do not</em> autobridge by default, but path-finding can find paths that have the same effect.</p>

<h3 id="special-issuer-values-for-sendmax-and-amount">Special issuer Values for SendMax and Amount</h3>
<p>Most of the time, the <code>issuer</code> field of a non-XRP <a href="reference-rippled.html#specifying-currency-amounts">Currency Amount</a> indicates a financial institution's <a href="concept-issuing-and-operational-addresses.html">issuing address</a>. However, when describing payments, there are special rules for the <code>issuer</code> field in the <code>Amount</code> and <code>SendMax</code> fields of a payment.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is only ever one balance for the same currency between two addresses. This means that, sometimes, the <code>issuer</code> field of an amount actually refers to a counterparty that is redeeming issuances, instead of the address that created the issuances.</li>
<li>When the <code>issuer</code> field of the destination <code>Amount</code> field matches the <code>Destination</code> address, it is treated as a special case meaning "any issuer that the destination accepts." This includes all addresses to which the destination has extended trust lines, as well as issuances created by the destination which are held on other trust lines.</li>
<li>When the <code>issuer</code> field of the <code>SendMax</code> field matches the source account's address, it is treated as a special case meaning "any issuer that the source can use." This includes creating new issuances on trust lines that other accounts have extended to the source account, and sending issuances the source account holds from other issuers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creating-accounts">Creating Accounts</h3>
<p>The Payment transaction type is the only way to create new accounts in the Ripple Consensus Ledger. To do so, send an amount of XRP that is equal or greater than the <a href="concept-reserves.html">account reserve</a> to a mathematically-valid account address that does not exist yet. When the Payment is processed, a new <a href="reference-ledger-format.html#accountroot">AccountRoot node</a> is added to the ledger.</p>
<p>If you send an insufficient amount of XRP, or any other currency, the Payment fails.</p>
<h3 id="paths">Paths</h3>
<p>If present, the <code>Paths</code> field must contain a <em>path set</em> - an array of path arrays. Each individual path represents one way value can flow from the sender to receiver through various intermediary accounts and order books. A single transaction can potentially use multiple paths, for example if the transaction exchanges currency using several different order books to achieve the best rate.</p>
<p>You must omit the <code>Paths</code> field for direct payments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An XRP-to-XRP transfer.</li>
<li>A direct transfer on a trust line that connects the sender and receiver.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>Paths</code> field is provided, the server decides at transaction processing time which paths to use, from the provided set plus a <em>default path</em> (the most direct way possible to connect the specified accounts). This decision is deterministic and attempts to minimize costs, but it is not guaranteed to be perfect.</p>
<p>The <code>Paths</code> field must not be an empty array, nor an array whose members are all empty arrays.</p>

<h3 id="partial-payments">Partial Payments</h3>
<p>A partial payment allows a payment to succeed by reducing the amount received. Partial payments are useful for <a href="tutorial-gateway-guide.html#bouncing-payments">returning payments</a> without incurring additional costs to oneself. However, partial payments can also be used to exploit integrations that naively assume the <code>Amount</code> field of a successful transaction always describes the exact amount delivered.</p>
<p>A partial payment is any <a href="#payment">Payment transaction</a> with the <strong>tfPartialPayment</strong> flag enabled. A partial payment can be successful if it delivers any positive amount greater than or equal to its <code>DeliverMin</code> field (or any positive amount at all if <code>DeliverMin</code> is not specified) without sending more than the <code>SendMax</code> value.</p>
<p>The <a href="#delivered-amount"><code>delivered_amount</code></a> field of a payment's metadata indicates the amount of currency actually received by the destination account.</p>
<p>For more information, see the full article on <a href="concept-partial-payments.html">Partial Payments</a>.</p>
<h3 id="limit-quality">Limit Quality</h3>
<p>Ripple defines the "quality" of a currency exchange as the ratio of the numeric amount in to the numeric amount out. For example, if you spend $2 USD to receive £1 GBP, then the "quality" of that exchange is <code>0.5</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="#payment-flags"><em>tfLimitQuality</em> flag</a> allows you to set a minimum quality of conversions that you are willing to take. This limit quality is defined as the destination <code>Amount</code> divided by the <code>SendMax</code> amount (the numeric amounts only, regardless of currency). When set, the payment processing engine avoids using any paths whose quality (conversion rate) is worse (numerically lower) than the limit quality.</p>
<p>By itself, the tfLimitQuality flag reduces the number of situations in which a transaction can succeed. Specifically, it rejects payments where some part of the payment uses an unfavorable conversion, even if the overall average <em>average</em> quality of conversions in the payment is equal or better than the limit quality. If a payment is rejected in this way, the <a href="#transaction-results">transaction result</a> is <code>tecPATH_DRY</code>.</p>
<p>Consider the following example. If I am trying to send you 100 Chinese Yuan (<code>Amount</code> = 100 CNY) for 20 United States dollars (<code>SendMax</code> = 20 USD) or less, then the limit quality is <code>5</code>. Imagine one trader is offering ¥95 for $15 (a ratio of about <code>6.3</code> CNY per USD), but the next best offer in the market is ¥5 for $2 (a ratio of <code>2.5</code> CNY per USD). If I were to take both offers to send you 100 CNY, then it would cost me 17 USD, for an average quality of about <code>5.9</code>.</p>
<p>Without the tfLimitQuality flag set, this transaction would succeed, because the $17 it costs me is within my specified <code>SendMax</code>. However, with the tfLimitQuality flag enabled, the transaction would fail instead, because the path to take the second offer has a quality of <code>2.5</code>, which is worse than the limit quality of <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>The tfLimitQuality flag is most useful when combined with <a href="#partial-payments">partial payments</a>. When both <em>tfPartialPayment</em> and <em>tfLimitQuality</em> are set on a transaction, then the transaction delivers as much of the destination <code>Amount</code> as it can, without using any conversions that are worse than the limit quality.</p>
<p>In the above example with a ¥95/$15 offer and a ¥5/$2 offer, the situation is different if my transaction has both tfPartialPayment and tfLimitQuality enabled. If we keep my <code>SendMax</code> of 20 USD and a destination <code>Amount</code> of 100 CNY, then the limit quality is still <code>5</code>. However, because I am doing a partial payment, the transaction sends as much as it can instead of failing if the full destination amount cannot be sent. This means that my transaction consumes the ¥95/$15 offer, whose quality is about <code>6.3</code>, but it rejects the ¥5/$2 offer because that offer's quality of <code>2.5</code> is worse than the quality limit of <code>5</code>. In the end, my transaction only delivers ¥95 instead of the full ¥100, but it avoids wasting money on poor exchange rates.</p>

<li>Clear a pending <code>Expiration</code> time.</li>
<li>Close a channel immediately, with or without processing a claim first. The source address cannot close the channel immediately if the channel has XRP remaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>destination address</strong> of a channel can:</p>

<li>Receive XRP from the channel using a signed Claim.</li>
<li>Close the channel immediately after processing a Claim, refunding any unclaimed XRP to the channel's source.</li>

<p>In addition to the master key, which is mathematically-related to an address, you can associate <strong>at most 1 additional key pair</strong> with an address using this type of transaction. The additional key pair is called a <em>regular key</em>. If your address has a regular key pair defined, you can use the secret key of the regular key pair to <a href="#authorizing-transactions">authorize transactions</a>.</p>
<p>A regular key pair is generated in the same way as any other Ripple keys (for example, with <a href="reference-rippled.html#wallet-propose">wallet_propose</a>), but it can be changed. A master key pair is an intrinsic part of an address's identity (the address is derived from the master public key). You can <a href="#accountset-flags">disable</a> a master key but you cannot change it.</p>
<p>You can protect your master secret by using a regular key instead of the master key to sign transactions whenever possible. If your regular key is compromised, but the master key is not, you can use a SetRegularKey transaction to regain control of your address. In some cases, you can even send a <a href="concept-transaction-cost.html#key-reset-transaction">key reset transaction</a> without paying the <a href="#transaction-cost">transaction cost</a>.</p>
<p>For even greater security, you can use <a href="#multi-signing">multi-signing</a>, but multi-signing requires additional XRP for the <a href="concept-transaction-cost.html">transaction cost</a> and <a href="concept-reserves.html">reserve</a>.</p>

<h3 id="trust-limits">Trust Limits</h3>
<p>All balances on the Ripple Consensus Ledger (RCL), except for XRP, represent value owed in the world outside the Ripple Ledger. The address that issues those funds in Ripple (identified by the <code>issuer</code> field of the <code>LimitAmount</code> object) is expected to pay the balance back, outside of the Ripple Consensus Ledger, when users redeem their Ripple balances by returning them to the issuer.</p>
<p>Since a computer program cannot force a someone to keep a promise and not default in real life, trust lines represent a way of configuring how much you trust an issuer to hold on your behalf. Since a large, reputable financial institution is more likely to be able to pay you back than, say, your broke roommate, you can set different limits on each trust line, to indicate the maximum amount you are willing to let the issuer "owe" you in the RCL. If the issuer defaults or goes out of business, you can lose up to that much money because the balances you hold in the Ripple Consensus Ledger can no longer be exchanged for equivalent balances elsewhere. (You can still keep or trade the issuances in the RCL, but they no longer have any reason to be worth anything.)</p>
<p>There are two cases where you can hold a balance on a trust line that is <em>greater</em> than your limit: when you acquire more of that currency through <a href="#offercreate">trading</a>, or when you decrease the limit on your trust line.</p>
<p>Since a trust line occupies space in the ledger, <a href="concept-reserves.html">a trust line increases the XRP your account must hold in reserve</a>. This applies to the account extending trust, not to the account receiving it.</p>
<p>A trust line with settings in the default state is equivalent to no trust line.</p>
<p>The default state of all flags is off, except for the <a href="concept-noripple.html">NoRipple flag</a>, whose default state depends on the DefaultRipple flag.</p>
<p>The Auth flag of a trust line does not determine whether the trust line counts towards its owner's XRP reserve requirement. However, an enabled Auth flag prevents the trust line from being in its default state. An authorized trust line can never be deleted. An issuer can pre-authorize a trust line with the <code>tfSetfAuth</code> flag only, even if the limit and balance of the trust line are 0.</p>

<p>The distinction between a local error (<code>tel</code>) and a malformed transaction (<code>tem</code>) is a matter of protocol-level rules. For example, the protocol sets no limit on the maximum number of paths that can be included in a transaction. However, a server may define a finite limit of paths it can process. If two different servers are configured differently, then one of them may return a <code>tel</code> error for a transaction with many paths, while the other server could successfully process the transaction. If enough servers are able to process the transaction that it survives consensus, then it can still be included in a validated ledger.</p>
<p>By contrast, a <code>tem</code> error implies that no server anywhere can apply the transaction, regardless of settings. Either the transaction breaks the rules of the protocol, it is unacceptably ambiguous, or it is completely nonsensical. The only way a malformed transaction could become valid is through changes in the protocol; for example, if a new feature is adopted, then transactions using that feature could be considered malformed by servers that are running older software which predates that feature.</p>
<h2 id="claimed-cost-justification">Claimed Cost Justification</h2>
<p>Although it may seem unfair to charge a <a href="concept-transaction-cost.html">transaction cost</a> for a failed transaction, the <code>tec</code> class of errors exists for good reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transactions submitted after the failed one do not have to have their Sequence values renumbered. Incorporating the failed transaction into a ledger uses up the transaction's sequence number, preserving the expected sequence.</li>
<li>Distributing the transaction throughout the network increases network load. Enforcing a cost makes it harder for attackers to abuse the network with failed transactions.</li>
<li>The transaction cost is generally very small in real-world value, so it should not harm users unless they are sending large quantities of transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finality-of-results">Finality of Results</h2>
<p>The order in which transactions apply to the consensus ledger is not final until a ledger is closed and the exact transaction set is approved by the consensus process. A transaction that succeeded initially could still fail, and a transaction that failed initially could still succeed. Additionally, a transaction that was rejected by the consensus process in one round could achieve consensus in a later round.</p>
<p>A validated ledger can include successful transactions (<code>tes</code> result codes) as well as failed transactions (<code>tec</code> result codes). No transaction with any other result is included in a ledger.</p>
<p>For any other result code, it can be difficult to determine if the result is final. The following table summarizes when a transaction's outcome is final, based on the result code from submitting the transaction:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Error Code</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>tesSUCCESS</code></td>
<td align="left">Final when included in a validated ledger</td>

<td align="left"><code>tefMAX_LEDGER</code></td>
<td align="left">Final when a validated ledger has a sequence number higher than the transaction's <code>LastLedgerSequence</code> field, and no validated ledger includes the transaction</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Any other transaction result is potentially not final. In that case, the transaction could still succeed or fail later, especially if conditions change such that the transaction is no longer prevented from applying. For example, trying to send a non-XRP currency to an account that does not exist yet would fail, but it could succeed if another transaction sends enough XRP to create the destination account. A server might even store a temporarily-failed, signed transaction and then successfully apply it later without asking first.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-transaction-metadata">Understanding Transaction Metadata</h2>
<p>The metadata section of a transaction includes detailed information about all the changes to the shared Ripple Consensus Ledger that the transaction caused. This is true of any transaction that gets included in a ledger, whether or not it is successful. Naturally, the changes are only final if the transaction is validated.</p>

<h3 id="delivered-amount">delivered_amount</h3>
<p>The <code>Amount</code> of a <a href="#payment">Payment transaction</a> indicates the amount to deliver to the <code>Destination</code>, so if the transaction was successful, then the destination received that much -- <strong>except if the transaction was a <a href="#partial-payments">partial payment</a></strong>. (In that case, any positive amount up to <code>Amount</code> might have arrived.) Rather than choosing whether or not to trust the <code>Amount</code> field, you should use the <code>delivered_amount</code> field of the metadata to see how much actually reached its destination.</p>
<p>The <code>delivered_amount</code> field of transaction metadata is included in all successful Payment transactions, and is formatted like a normal currency amount. However, the delivered amount is not available for transactions that meet both of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a partial payment, and</li>
<li>Included in a validated ledger before 2014-01-20</li>
</ul>
<p>If both conditions are true, then <code>delivered_amount</code> contains the string value <code>unavailable</code> instead of an actual amount. If this happens, you can only figure out the actual delivered amount by reading the AffectedNodes in the transaction's metadata.</p>

<p>The code <code>tesSUCCESS</code> is the only code that indicates a transaction succeeded. This does not always mean it did what it was supposed to do. (For example, an <a href="#offercancel">OfferCancel</a> can "succeed" even if there is no offer for it to cancel.) Success uses the numerical value 0.</p>
